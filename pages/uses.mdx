# Uses

Inspired by Wes Bos' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech), I have put together a list of my current setup.

## Applications

### Visual Studio Code

Not only do I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for code, but I also write pretty much everything else in there. In comparison to word processors such as [Microsoft Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/word), VS Code doesn't allow you to format text as such, which means I have one less opportunity to procrastinate on whatever I am writing.

VS Code also has an amazing ecosystem of extensions. Those I use are listed in my [Mac Setup](/mac-setup) process.

### Browsers

My main browser is the MacOS default browser, [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/). Despite its bad reputation, it is good looking and works well with Apple Keychain, so there is no need to use a 3rd party password manager.

During development, I also test on [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Web Services

### GitHub

I host all of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com). All of my code repositories are public.

I also use GitHub private repositories as a backup for personal stuff, such as essays, etc.

### Vercel

All of my web-based projects are hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). They are specifically designed to host [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) applications (such as this one), since they are the creators and maintainers of Next.js. They also offer a [generous free tier](https://vercel.com/pricing), which is an added bonus.

## Command Line Stuff

### Terminal

I use the default MacOS Terminal. MacOS ships with it, and it serves its purpose. End of story.

### Fish Shell

My default shell is [fish](https://fishshell.com) (**f**riendly **i**nteractive **sh**ell). It's syntax is nice, but its real value lies with its inbuilt autocompletion. Fish also comes with a few other small improvements, such as `..` mapping to `cd ..`.

### Starship

As a shell prompt, I use [Starship](https://starship.rs). It shows information relevant to the directory one is currently in, such as git status, npm version, and the time the last command took to execute. Starship is a cross-shell prompt, so it integrates smoothly with fish.

## Fonts

### Fira Code

For code, I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) because of the awesome ligatures it ships with. I have it enabled in both VS Code and the default MacOS terminal.

### Inter

Recently, I have started using [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) because of its clean look and feel. I came across it because [Vercel](https://vercel.com) uses it for their interfaces and I really enjoy [their designs](https://vercel.com/design). I am also using Inter on the third generation of my personal website.
