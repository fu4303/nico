                Hi, I'm Nico. I'm a High School Student, Hobby Developer, and
                Aspiring Open Sourcerer currently living in Luxembourg.
            </p>
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, most of my projects have been web-based, but I want
                to explore more areas of development as well. I'm currently also
                learning Rust and systems-level programming.
            </p>
            <h2>Articles</h2>
            <p>
                I want to start writing articles soon, but currently don't quite
                know where to start yet.
            </p>
