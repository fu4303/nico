# SOS School

SOS School ia a student initiative with the goal of helping primary schools in Luxembourg in their scholarly endeavours following the COVID-19 lockdowns.

In addition to co-mananging the project, I was responsible for creating the [Website](https://www.sos-school.org).

Since Luxembourg is a very multilingual country, I had to find a way to explain the project to everyone. The solution I went with in the end was leveraging the excellent [Next.js internationalisation (i18n) routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing). This enabled me to serve the appropriate translation of our project information to each visitor of the page.
