# The First Martian

The First Martian is an Indie Space Exploration Game. It is a team project created for the 2019 Luxembourg Tech School Game Development Competition. Our team received the 1st prize for our game.

## About the Game

The game is similar to _Thrust_, a 1986 video game. The objective is to navigate a spaceship from the launch platform to the landing platform. As the levels progress, there are increasing amounts of obstacles to be avoided.

The spaceship also has a limited fuel supply. Therefore, the player needs to collect fuel tanks along their way.

Even if the player succeeds in completing all six levels, they may still incur a total loss in funds if the lives of too many astronauts are lost. In order to win the game, all six levels must be completed without a single loss of life.

## Demo
